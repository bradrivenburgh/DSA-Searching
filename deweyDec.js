Dewey Decimal System
Each subject is broken up into 10 smaller, more specific categories.

000 – Computer science, information, and general works
100 – Philosophy and psychology
200 – Religion
300 – Social sciences
400 – Language
500 – Science
600 – Technology
700 – Arts and recreation
800 – Literature
900 – History and geography

Each category is then divided into subseries separated by 10.
Further subdivisions extend to decimal numbers
